**A Windows 11 and Windows 10 taskbar widget that shows your Claude Code and OpenAI Codex subscription usage (5-hour and weekly limits) next to a CPU, RAM, GPU and disk monitor.** One native `.exe` under 1 MB, written in Rust. No runtime, no telemetry, no login screen: it reuses your existing `claude` / `codex` CLI login.

A tiny, always-visible strip pinned over the **left corner of the Windows taskbar** that shows, at a glance:

1. **Hardware usage**, like the *Performance* tab of Task Manager: CPU, RAM, GPU, and the active time of each physical disk.
2. **Claude Code and Codex subscription limits**: the percentage **used** of the 5-hour window and of the weekly window.

No panel to open, no window to switch to. Just glance at the taskbar.

## Status

**Early development (v0.2).** The strip, the hardware and limit readings, the tooltip, the menu, and the settings window work on Windows 11 and Windows 10. Expect rough edges; bug reports are very welcome.

## Why

Know, without interrupting your work, whether your PC is under load and how much of your AI coding quota is left before you start a big task.

## Goals

- **Truly lightweight**: a single `.exe` under 1 MB, no runtime to install, about 15 MB of RAM and near-zero CPU while running (see the [Task Manager screenshot](#how-much-memory-and-cpu-does-it-use)).
- **Standalone**: download and run. The app itself offers "Start with Windows".
- **Native**: written in Rust using raw Win32 via the [`windows`](https://crates.io/crates/windows) crate, drawn with Direct2D/DirectWrite.
- **Honest numbers**: an expired token or a broken endpoint shows a clear error state, never a fake `0%` or silently stale data.

## Features

- **Hardware items**: CPU, RAM, GPU (busiest engine, like Task Manager), and per-disk active time (one item per physical disk, labeled with its drive letters).
- **Subscription limits**:
  - **Claude Code**: 5-hour and weekly usage, using your existing `claude` CLI login. Hover for available Opus/Sonnet weekly limits and extra-usage status; see [Claude usage details](docs/claude-usage.md).
  - **Codex**: 5-hour and weekly usage, using your existing `codex` CLI login.
- **Toggles**: every item and every provider can be turned on or off independently. Disabled items disappear and the strip shrinks.
- **Color cues**: progress bars turn yellow near the limit and red when close to it.
- **Hover** for a tooltip with reset times, last update time, and error details.
- **Right-click** for a menu: **Settings**, **Refresh now**, **Start with Windows**, **Exit**.
- **Plays nice with the taskbar** (see below).

### Stays out of your way

- **Full screen:** the strip hides while a full-screen app (a YouTube video, a game, a presentation) is on the taskbar's monitor and comes back as soon as you leave full screen. Full screen on another monitor leaves it alone.
- **Display scaling:** it follows Windows display scaling (100%, 125%, 150%, …) per monitor, and stays sharp after a change.
- **Light and dark theme:** text and bar colors follow the Windows theme, switching live.
- **Taskbar icons:** it never covers the taskbar icons. When apps open and the centered icons shift, the strip shrinks (compact mode, then `…`).
- **Auto-hide and Explorer restarts:** it hides together with an auto-hidden taskbar and comes back on its own after Explorer restarts.
- **Sleep:** after resume it fetches fresh limits right away and never shows old numbers as current.

### Not planned (for v1)

- macOS or Linux support.
- A Windows Widgets board (Win+W) widget.
- Its own login screen or OAuth flow.
- Usage history or charts over time.

## Requirements

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 (x64). ARM64 is desirable but not guaranteed yet.
- No administrator privileges required.
- For the limits items: a logged-in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and/or Codex CLI on the same Windows user account.

## Installation

> Upgrading from v0.1.x (`widget-usage-windows.exe`)? Just run the new `claude-codex-taskbar.exe`: it closes the old version, keeps your settings and moves *Start with Windows* to the new executable. You can then delete the old `.exe`.

1. Download `claude-codex-taskbar-<version>-x64.zip` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) and extract it (or grab the bare `claude-codex-taskbar.exe`). It is a single file (under 1 MB): no installer, no runtime dependencies.
2. Put it somewhere permanent (for example `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\claude-codex-taskbar\`) and run it.
3. Right-click the strip → **Start with Windows** to launch it at sign-in (stored under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`).

A `winget` package will follow after the first stable releases.

### "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen)

Release builds are not code-signed yet, so SmartScreen may warn about an unrecognized app. Click **More info → Run anyway**. To make sure the file is the one published here, compare its hash with `SHA256SUMS.txt` attached to the release:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\claude-codex-taskbar.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

### Building from source

```powershell
cargo build --release   # target\release\claude-codex-taskbar.exe
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the toolchain setup.

## Usage

- **Free the left corner.** The strip lives where the Windows Widgets (weather) button sits. Turn that button off in *Settings → Personalization → Taskbar → Widgets*. Keep the taskbar icons **centered** (*Taskbar behaviors → Taskbar alignment*); with left-aligned icons there is no room and the strip stays hidden.
- **Not enough room?** The strip first drops the labels (compact mode), then hides items from the end and shows `…`. Hover to see what was cut, or turn items off in **Settings**.
- **Toggle providers and items** in **Settings** (right-click → Settings). On first run, Claude and Codex are enabled automatically if their CLI login is found.
- **Claude shows `—` after a few hours?** Claude Code's login token lasts about 8 hours and is renewed only by Claude Code itself. The app never refreshes it (so it can never log the CLI out); open Claude Code and the numbers come back on the next refresh.
- **Keep login active (experimental, off by default), for Claude Code and Codex.** If you opt in (the app asks once on first run; also in **Settings**, one switch per provider), when a token has expired the app runs the CLI's own status command hidden (`claude auth status` or `codex login status`), at most every 15 minutes per provider, so the official CLI renews its own login. It sends no prompt and uses no quota. The tooltip tells you whether the renewal worked. **Feedback wanted:** please open an issue saying whether it renewed your login.
- **Codex offline?** If the endpoint fails, the strip falls back to the last limits the Codex CLI wrote to its session logs, dimmed, as long as that window has not reset yet.

## Privacy

- **No telemetry.** The app does not phone home, collect analytics, or check for updates in the background.
- **Network access is limited** to the providers' own usage endpoints, and only for the providers you enable.
- **Credentials are read-only.** The app reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and `~/.codex/auth.json` (respecting `CODEX_HOME`) but never writes to them, never refreshes tokens, and never competes with the official CLIs.
- **Credentials are never logged, copied, or sent anywhere** except to the corresponding provider's own endpoint.
- **No other programs are run**, unless you turn on *Keep login active*, which runs only `claude auth status` and/or `codex login status` (hidden, output discarded).
- Settings are stored locally in `%APPDATA%`.

## Disclaimer

- This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic or OpenAI**. "Claude", "Claude Code", "Codex", and related names are trademarks of their respective owners.
- The subscription-limit data comes from **unofficial, undocumented endpoints** (the same ones the official CLIs use for their own usage/status commands). They **may change or break at any time** without notice. When that happens, the app shows an error state rather than wrong numbers.
- Use at your own risk, and make sure your usage complies with the terms of service of each provider.

## FAQ

### How do I see my Claude Code usage limits on Windows without opening a terminal?
Install this app: the taskbar shows the percentage used of your Claude Code 5-hour session window and weekly limit (the same numbers as `/usage` in Claude Code), updated every 2 minutes. Hover for the reset times.

### How do I check my Codex (ChatGPT plan) rate limits on Windows?
Same app: with the Codex CLI logged in (`codex login`), the strip shows the 5-hour and weekly percentages that `/status` reports in Codex.

### Does it need an API key or my password?
No. It reads the login that the official `claude` and `codex` CLIs already saved on your PC, read-only, and talks only to the providers' own endpoints.

### Does it work on Windows 10?
Yes. It runs on Windows 11 and Windows 10 (x64).

### Does it work on macOS or Linux?
No. It targets the Windows taskbar. On macOS, menu-bar apps cover the same need (see below).

### How much memory and CPU does it use?
Less than 16 MB of memory and near-zero CPU, with no disk or network activity between limit refreshes. Hardware is sampled once per second through the same performance counters Task Manager uses.
